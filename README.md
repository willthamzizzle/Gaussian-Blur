Gaussian-Blur
=============

an implementation of the gaussian blur in c and CUDA

This was our small teams implementation of the guassian blur in CUDA circa 2010. 
I'm pretty sure things have changed considerably from then so I am not too sure if this even compiles correctly anymore. 
I'll test it again eventually but for now its just a simple gaussian blur using Nvidia gpus.
